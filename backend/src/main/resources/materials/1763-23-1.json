It was added to Annex B of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in May 2009. PFOS can form from the degradation of precursors in addition to industrial production. The PFOS levels that have been detected in wildlife are considered high enough to affect health parameters, and recently higher serum levels of PFOS were found to be associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease in the general US population, consistent with earlier animal studies. This association was independent of confounders such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, and serum cholesterol level.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

In the following 28-d depuration period the fish were fed PFAA-free food. At defined sampling times four animals were removed from the experimental tank, euthanized and dissected. Muscle, liver, kidneys, gills, blood, skin and carcass were examined individually. At the end of the accumulation phase between 0.63% (PFOA) and 15.5% (PFOS) of the absolute, applied quantity of PFAAs was recovered in the whole fish. The main target organ was the liver with recovery rates between 0.11% (PFBS) and 4.01% (PFOS) of the total amount of ingested PFAAs. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids were taken up more readily and had longer estimated elimination half-lives than perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids of the same chain length. The longest estimated elimination half-lives were found to be for PFOS between 8.4 d in muscle tissue and 20.4 d in the liver and for PFNA between 8.2 d in the blood and 11.6 d in the liver.",

Higher concentrations have been observed in adult males compared to females, with a possible explanation that menstruation offers females an additional elimination route. In this study, we examined the significance of blood loss as an elimination route of PFAAs. Pooled serum samples were collected from individuals undergoing a medical procedure involving ongoing blood withdrawal called venesection. Concentrations from male venesection patients were approximately 40% lower than males in the general population for perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). A simple pharmacokinetic model was used to test the hypothesis that blood loss could explain why adult males have higher concentrations of PFAAs than females, and why males undergoing venesections had lower concentrations compared to males in the general population. The model application generally supported these hypotheses showing that venesection might reduce blood serum concentrations by 37% (PFOA) and 53% (PFOS) compared to the observed difference of 44% and 37%. Menstruation was modeled to show a 22% reduction in PFOA serum concentrations compared to a 24% difference in concentrations between males and females in the background population. Uncertainties in the modeling and the data are identified and discussed.",

PFOS and PFOA were detected in 48 and 76% of adult urine (AU) samples, with geometric mean (GM) concentrations of 0.011 and 0.008 ng/mL, respectively; whereas relatively low PFOS and PFOA concentrations were found in maternal urine (MU) samples, with GM concentrations of 0.006 and 0.003 ng/mL, respectively. For PFOA, the coefficients of Pearson's correlation between whole blood concentrations and creatinine-adjusted and creatinine-unadjusted urinary concentrations were 0.348 (p=0.013) and 0.417 (p=0.002), respectively. The GM urinary elimination rates of PFOS (PFOSUER) and PFOA (PFOAUER) were 16 and 25%, respectively, for adults. These results indicate that urine is an important pathway of excretion of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). The partitioning ratios of PFAS concentration between urine and whole blood (PFASU/B) in pregnant women (PFOSU/B, 0.0004; PFOAU/B, 0.0011) were significantly lower (p=0.025 for PFOSU/B, p=0.017 for PFOAU/B) than the ratios found in non-pregnant women (PFOSU/B, 0.0013; PFOAU/B, 0.0028). Furthermore, our results suggest a clear gender difference in the urinary elimination of PFOA, with male adults (31%) having significantly higher PFOAUER than that of female adults (19%). PFOSUER was significantly inversely correlated with age (r=-0.334, p=0.015); these findings suggest that urinary elimination of PFOS is faster in young adults than in the elderly.",

This association could be attributable to glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is related to PFAS concentration and birth weight. We used a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of pregnancy to assess how much of the PFAS-birth weight association observed in epidemiologic studies might be attributable to GFR. We modified a PBPK model to reflect the association of GFR with birth weight (estimated from three studies of GFR and birth weight) and used it to simulate PFAS concentrations in maternal and cord plasma. The model was run 250,000 times, with variation in parameters, to simulate a population. Simulated data were analyzed to evaluate the association between PFAS levels and birth weight due to GFR. We compared simulated estimates with those from a meta-analysis of epidemiologic data. The reduction in birth weight for each 1-ng/mL increase in simulated cord plasma for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was 2.72 g (95% CI: -3.40, -2.04), and for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was 7.13 g (95% CI: -8.46, -5.80); results based on maternal plasma at term were similar. Results were sensitive to variations in PFAS level distributions and the strength of the GFR-birth weight association. In comparison, our meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies suggested that each 1-ng/mL increase in prenatal PFOS and PFOA levels was associated with 5.00 g (95% CI: -21.66, -7.78) and 14.72 g (95% CI: -8.92, -1.09) reductions in birth weight, respectively. Results of our simulations suggest that a substantial proportion of the association between prenatal PFAS and birth weight may be attributable to confounding by GFR and that confounding by GFR may be more important in studies with sample collection later in pregnancy.",

The N-EtFOSE metabolite profile in liver and serum was in good agreement with reported in vitro biotransformation pathways in rats and the metabolite levels decreasing in the order perfluorooctanesulfonate >> perfluorooctanesulfonamide ~ N-ethyl perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetate >> perfluorooctanesulfonamidoethanol approximately N-EtFOSE. Although N-EtFOSE treatment significantly decreased the growth rate, increased relative liver weight and activity of superoxide dismutases (SOD) in liver and uterus (total SOD, CuZnSOD and MnSOD), a metabolic  study revealed no differences in the metabolome in serum from N-EtFOSE-treated and control animals. Ciprofibrate treatment increased liver weight and peroxisomal acyl Co-A oxidase activity in the liver and altered antioxidant enzyme activities in the uterus and liver. According to NMR metabolomic studies, ciprofibrate treated animals had altered serum lipid profiles compared to N-EtFOSE-treated and control animals, whereas putative markers of peroxisome proliferation in serum were not affected. ... /Perfluorooctane sulfonate/",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity of PFOS remain largely unknown. It has been widely acknowledged that the inflammatory mediators released by hyper-activated microglia play vital roles in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases. In the present study, we examined the impact of PFOS exposure on microglial activation and the release of proinflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxidative species (ROS). We found that PFOS exposure led to concentration-dependent NO and ROS production by rat HAPI microglia. We also discovered that there was rapid activation of the ERK/JNK MAPK signaling pathway in the HAPI microglia following PFOS treatment. Moreover, the PFOS-induced iNOS expression and NO production were attenuated after the inhibition of ERK or JNK MAPK by their corresponding inhibitors, PD98059 and SP600125. Interestingly, NAC, a ROS inhibitor, blocked iNOS expression, NO production, and activation of ERK and JNK MAPKs, which suggested that PFOS-mediated microglial NO production occurs via a ROS/ERK/JNK MAPK signaling pathway. Finally, by exposing SH-SY5Y cells to PFOS-treated microglia-conditioned medium, we demonstrated that NO was responsible for PFOS-mediated neuronal apoptosis.",

A dose-dependent induction of VTG was observed in E2-, 4-NP-, PFOS-, PFOA- and 6:2 FTOH-treated cells, whereas VTG levels remained unchanged in the 4:2 FTOH and 8:2 FTOH exposure groups at the concentrations tested. The estimated 48-hr EC(50) values for E2, 4-NP, PFOS, PFOA and 6:2 FTOH were 4.7 x 10-7, 7.1 x 10-6, 1.5 x 10-5, 2.9 x 10-5 and 2.8 x 10-5 M, respectively. In the time-course study, significant VTG induction took place at 24 hr (E2), 6 hr (4-NP), 48 hr (PFOS), 48 hr (PFOA), 72 hr (4:2 FTOH), 12 hr (6:2 FTOH), 72 hr (8:2 FTOH), and increased further after 96 h of exposure. Co-exposure to binary mixtures of individual PFCs and E2 for 48 hr significantly inhibited E2-induced hepatocellular VTG production in a dose-dependent manner except for 4:2 FTOH. The estimated 48-h IC(50) (concentration of a compound that elicits 50% inhibition of maximally E2-induced VTG) values for PFOS, PFOA, 6:2 FTOH and 8:2 FTOH were 3.1 x 10-7, 5.1 x 10-7, 1.1 x 10-6 and 7.5 x 10-7 M, respectively. In order to further investigate the estrogenic mechanism of PFCs, the hepatocytes were co-exposed to binary mixtures of individual chemicals (E2, 4-NP, PFOS, PFOA and 6:2 FTOH) and the known estrogen receptor inhibitor tamoxifen for 48 hr; tamoxifen significantly inhibited the ability of these chemicals to stimulate vitellogenesis. ... /Perfluorooctanyl sulfonate/",

These chemicals are collectively referred to as perfluoroalkyl sulfonates, or PFAS. This rule requires manufacturers and importers to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture or import of these chemical substances for the significant new uses described in this document. EPA believes that this action is necessary because the PFOSH component of these chemical substances may be hazardous to human health and the environment. The required notice will provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate an intended new use and associated activities and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before it occurs. ... The significant new uses described in this document are: 1. Any manufacture or import for any use of any chemical listed in Table 1, Unit I.A., on or after January 1, 2003, except as noted in Unit II.A.2. 2. Manufacture or import of any chemical listed in Table 1, Unit I.A., solely for one or more of the following specific uses shall not be considered as a significant new use subject to reporting under this section: i. Use as an anti-erosion additive in fire-resistant phosphate ester aviation hydraulic fluids. ii. Use as a component of a photoresist substance, including a photo acid generator or surfactant, or as a component of an anti-reflective coating, used in a photomicrolithography process to produce semiconductors or similar components of electronic or other miniaturized devices. iii. Use in coatings for surface tension, static discharge, and adhesion control for analog and digital imaging films, papers, and printing plates, or as a surfactant in mixtures used to process imaging films. iv.

Additionally, Toray Carbon Fibers America, Inc. (Toray) in Decatur historically used PFCs. In the past, 3M disposed of PFC waste on-site as well as in local landfills. Wastewater containing PFCs from the three industrial facilities was treated at the Decatur Utilities. In 2007, a local industry notified EPA that it had inadvertently discharged large quantities of a PFC to Decatur Utilities. At that time, biosolids from Decatur Utilities was being applied as a fertilizer on about 5000 acres of privately owned agricultural fields in Alabama's Lawrence, Morgan and Limestone counties. This practice had been ongoing since 1996. EPA regulations under the Clean Water Act allow biosolids to be applied as a fertilizer as long as certain operating and monitoring requirements are followed. PFCs are a class of man-made chemicals that, in most cases, are not regulated by EPA. Therefore, biosolids are typically not required to be tested for PFCs. In response to the notification, EPA tested biosolids and a limited set of soil samples from two agricultural sites where biosolids from Decatur Utilities had been applied. The results indicated elevated levels of perfluorooctyl sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other PFCs when compared with sampling results from industrial and residential sites.",

                          "String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) is a liquid. It is used as a chemical intermediate, an acid catalyst for photoresists, a surfactant in firefighting foam, a surfactant for alkaline cleaners, an emulsifier in floor polish, a mist suppressant for metal plating baths, a surfactant for etching acids for circuit boards, a pesticide active ingredient for ant bait traps, and an agricultural chemical. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Health effects of perfluoroalkyl-compounds on humans remain controversial, in spite of a number of experimental and epidemiological studies. In one study, subjects with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome had higher serum concentrations of PFOS. Some studies of women and infants found that PFOS levels negatively correlated with birth weight only in female infants, while other studies found the association to be small. Pre-natal exposure may be associated with immunosuppression in early childhood. Testosterone production may be compromised in individuals with high PFOS exposure. An occupational study conducted on volunteers working at two different 3M plants showed a relationship between higher PFOS serum levels and higher mean values for triglycerides, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, ALT, and serum triiodothyronine, as well as a lower thyroid hormone binding ratio. In a mortality study, which followed workers for 37 years, a statistically significant risk of death from bladder cancer was reported. In a different study, PFOS altered the expression of crucial genes, reduced ATP production, induced ROS, and stimulated apoptosis during the early stages of cardiogenesis. It appears that that PFOS induces apoptosis in A549 cells through a reactive oxygen species-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction pathway mechanism. PFOS suppressed IL-2 production in both a human cell line and human primary cells at dose levels within the high end of the human exposure range. In a study on serum levels of men and women, higher concentrations of PFOS were observed in men in comparison to women from the same populations. ANIMAL STUDIES: PFOS was found to be mildly irritating to the eyes and nonirritating to the skin of rabbits. Adverse signs of toxicity observed in rat studies included increases in liver enzymes, hepatic vacuolization and hepatocellular hypertrophy, GI effects, hematological abnormalities, weight loss, convulsions, and death. These effects were reported at doses of 2 mg/kg/day and above.  PFOS has shown moderate acute toxicity by the oral route in rats. Mice pups were administered PFOS by one subcutaneous injection. PFOS induced degression of the body weights of mice and increase of relative weights of liver. Results indicated that younger mice pups were more sensitive to PFOS exposure. Dietary treatment of male mice with 0.005% (w/w) PFOS for 10 days resulted in significant reductions in serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, a moderate increase in the serum activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and hepatomegaly, without affecting other immune organs. In rabbits, significant reductions in fetal body weight and significant increases in delayed ossification were observed in the offspring of pregnant females administered PFOS during gestation. PFOS was negative in mutagenicity studies in five strains of Salmonella and did not induce micronuclei in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. PFOS was carcinogenic in the rat, inducing tumors of the liver and the thyroid gland in the males and tumors of the liver and of the thyroid and mammary gland in females. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Based on a zebrafish study, early life stage exposure to PFOS perturbs various molecular pathways potentially resulting in observed defects in swim bladder and gut development. PFOS has adverse effects on hepato-histology and sexual development on X. laevis. PFOS can induce oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage repair systems with transcriptional regulation of detoxification, antioxidant, and apoptosis-related genes, resulting in developmental retardation and reduced fecundity in the copepod T. japonicus. Chronic exposure to PFOS can cause neurotoxicity and behavior defects in Caenorhabditis elegans. PFOS had significant effects on the growth of wheat seedlings under experimental conditions.",

Considering liver is the primary toxic target organ for chlorinated phenols and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), it is interesting to evaluate the possible joint effects of them on liver. In this work, the combined toxicity of pentachlorophenol (PCP) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were investigated using HepG2 cells. The results indicated that PFOS and PFOA could strengthen PCP's hepatotoxicity. Further studies showed that rather than intensify the oxidative stress or promote the biotransformation of PCP, PFOS (or PFOA) might lead to strengthening of the oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling of PCP. By measuring the intracellular PCP concentration and the cell membrane properties, it was suggested that PFOS and PFOA could disrupt the plasma membrane and increase the membrane permeability. Thus, more cellular accessibility of PCP was induced when they were co-exposed to PCP and PFOS (or PFOA), leading to increased cytotoxicity ...",

Neither the concentration-addition model nor the independent-action model could predict the combined effects when strong interactive effects existed. Although the interactive effects of PFOS and PFOA affected their combined toxicity, the trend of mixture toxicity still showed an increase with increasing molar ratios of PFOS in the mixture.",

It is commonly used as a dietary spice and coloring agent in cooking and anecdotally as an herb in traditional Asian medicine. In this study, male rats were treated with three different PFOS doses (0.6, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg) and one dose of curcumin, from Curcuma longa (80 mg/kg), and combined three doses of PFOS with 80 mg/kg dose of curcumin by gavage for 30 d at 48 hr intervals. Here, we investigated the DNA damage via single-cell gel electrophoresis/comet assay and micronucleus test in rat peripheral blood in vivo. It is found that all doses of PFOS increased micronucleus frequency (p<0.05) and strongly induced DNA damage in peripheral blood in two different parameters; the damaged cell percent and genetically damage index, and curcumin prevented the formation of DNA damage induced by PFOS. Results showed that curcumin inhibited DNA damage including GDI at certain levels at statistical manner, 30.07%, 54.41%, and 36.99% for 0.6 mg/kg, 1.25 mg/kg, and 2.5 mg/kg.",

A commonly reported condition in exposed animals is hypothyroxinemia, whereby serum free thyroxine (fT4) is decreased despite normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. We designed an individually matched case-control study to investigate whether exposure to perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was associated with hypothyroxinemia in pregnant women from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in 2005-2006, who underwent a \"triple screen\" blood test at 15-20 weeks gestation as part of ante-natal care. Thyroid hormones, fT4 and TSH, were measured in serum from 974 women, and from these we measured PFAs in the sera of 96 hypothyroxinemic cases (normal TSH, the lowest 10th percentile of fT4) and 175 controls (normal TSH, fT4 between the 50th and 90th percentiles) matched on age and referring physician. Analyses by conditional logistic regression indicated that the concentrations of PFAs in this population were not associated with hypothyroxinemia among pregnant women. The current findings do not support a causal link between PFA exposure and maternal hypothyroxinemia in the studied population.",

Serum PFOA and PFOS concentrations were measured in 1129 women in 2005-2006 who reported pregnancy outcomes in follow-up interviews between 2008 and 2011. In the analysis, we included 1438 reported live births, stillbirths, and miscarriages with estimated conception dates after the serum measurements. Preconception serum levels of PFOA and PFOS were analyzed in relation to miscarriage using logistic regression and generalized estimating equations. There was little evidence of association between PFOA and miscarriage. For PFOS, when including all reported prospective pregnancies, the odds ratio of miscarriage per log ng/mL increase was 1.21 (95% confidence interval = 0.94-1.55); in subanalyses restricted to each woman's first pregnancy conceived after the serum measurement, the odds ratio was 1.34 (1.02-1.76). Categorical analyses showed elevated odds ratios for the top 4 quintiles relative to the first quintile, without a monotonic trend. Positive associations between PFOS and miscarriage were strongest among nulligravid pregnancies. In this prospective study of miscarriage in a population exposed to high levels of PFOA and background levels of PFOS, we found little evidence of association with serum levels of PFOA and limited evidence of association with serum levels of PFOS.",

The objective of this case-control pilot study is to determine whether women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) have higher concentrations of specific environmental contaminants compared to women who have not developed PCOS. Fifty-two PCOS case-patients (diagnosed using the National Institutes of Health 1990 definition) and 50 controls were recruited in 2007-2008, from an urban academic medical center in Los Angeles, CA. Brominated diphenyl ethers, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) were measured in serum, and phthalates metabolites and bisphenol A (BPA) in urine. PCOS case-patients had significantly higher geometric mean (GM) serum concentrations of two PFCs: perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) (GMcases = 4.1 ug/L, GMcontrols = 2.3 ug/L; p = 0.001) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) (GMcases = 8.2 ug/L, GMcontrols = 4.9 ug/L; p = 0.01), and lower urinary concentrations of monobenzyl phthalate (mBzP) (GMcases = 7.5 ug/g creatinine, GMcontrols = 11.7 ug/g creatinine; p = 0.02). Logistic regression, controlling for body mass index, age and race, identified an increased likelihood of PCOS in subjects with higher serum concentrations of PFOA and PFOS (adjusted-ORs = 5.8-6.9, p < 0.05), and with lower urine concentrations of mBzP and mono-n-butyl phthalate (mBP) (aORs = 0.14-0.25, p < 0.05). Our data suggest that PCOS case-patients may differ from controls in their environmental contaminant profile. PCOS subjects had higher serum concentrations of two PFCs, PFOA and PFOS, and lower urine concentrations of mBP and mBzP. ...",

The objectives of this study were to (i) assess associations between thyroid function, as measured by serum thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), total thyroxine (T4), and total triiodothyronine (T3), and serum perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in an aging population and (ii) determine if other persistent organic pollutants with thyroid disruptive properties including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) modify such associations. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 87 men and women 55 to 74 years of age, without clinically-diagnosed thyroid disease, who resided in upper Hudson River communities in New York. Geometric means (standard deviations) of serum PFOS and PFOA were 31.6 (1.7) ng/mL and 9.17 (1.72) ng/mL, respectively. Multivariable linear regression analyses indicated that one interquartile range difference in PFOS corresponded to 4% and 9% increases in fT4 and T4 respectively. We detected statistical interactions between PFOA and age for effects on fT4 and T4; joint increases in PFOA and age were associated with increases in fT4 and T4, of 3% and 7%, respectively. We also detected statistical interactions between PFOS and total PCBs for the effect on T3 and between PFOA and total PBDEs for the effect on TSH. Our results suggest that PFASs are associated with subtle alterations in thyroid hormone levels in this population, and that these associations are likely to vary by age, and levels of PCBs and PBDEs.",

Adverse signs of toxicity observed in 90-day rat studies included increases in liver enzymes, hepatic vacuolization and hepatocellular hypertrophy, gastrointestinal effects, hematological abnormalities, weight loss, convulsions, and death. These effects were reported at doses of 2 mg/kg/day and above. In a dietary 2-year bioassay in Sprague-Dawley rats, hepatotoxicity, characterized by centrilobular hypertrophy, centrilobular eosinophilic hepatocytic granules, centrilobular hepatocytic pigment, or centrilobular hepatocytic vacuolation was noted in male and/or female rats given 5 or 20 ppm. Hepatocellular centrilobular hypertrophy was also observed in mid-dose (2 ppm) male rats. Significant increases in the incidence of cystic hepatocellular degeneration were found in all the male treated groups (0.5, 2, 5, or 20 ppm). Based on the pathological findings in the liver, the LOAEL was 5 ppm and the NOAEL was 2 ppm in female rats. In males, the LOAEL was 0.5 ppm, and a NOAEL was not established.",

Dietary treatment of male C57BL/6 mice with 0.002% (w/w) PFOA or 0.005% (w/w) PFOS for 10 days resulted in significant reductions in serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, a moderate increase in the serum activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and hepatomegaly, without affecting other immune organs. This hepatomegaly was associated with marked hypertrophy of the centrilobular hepatocytes, with elevated numbers of cytoplasmic acidophilic granules and occasional mitosis. Furthermore, dietary exposure to PFOA or PFOS altered the hepatic immune status: whereas exposure to PFOA enhanced the numbers of total, as well as of phenotypically distinct subpopulations of intrahepatic immune cells (IHIC), and in particular the presumptive erythrocyte progenitor cells, treatment with PFOS enhanced only the numbers of hepatic cells that appear immunophenotypically to be erythrocyte progenitors, without affecting other types of IHIC. In addition, exposure to these compounds attenuated hepatic levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). Furthermore, the exposed animals exhibited a significant increase in hepatic levels of erythropoietin, a hormone required for erythropoiesis. ...",

Despite the widespread occurrence of perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs), little is known about the impact these contaminants have on the health of wildlife populations. The authors investigated the relationship between PFCs (including sigma-perfluorocarboxylates, sigma-perfluoroalkyl sulfonates, perfluorooctane sulfonate, perfluorooctanoic acid, and perfluorodecanoic acid) and the clinocopathologic and immune parameters in a highly exposed population (n=79) of Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (mean sigma-PFCs = 1970 ng/mL; range 574-8670 ng/mL) sampled from 2003 to 2005 near Charleston, South Carolina, USA. Age-adjusted linear regression models showed statistically significant positive associations between exposure to one or more of the PFC totals and/or individual analytes and the following immunological parameters: absolute numbers of CD2+ T cells, CD4+ helper T cells, CD19+ immature B cells, CD21+ mature B cells, CD2/CD21 ratio, MHCII+ cells, B cell proliferation, serum IgG1, granulocytic, and monocytic phagocytosis. Several PFC analyte groups were also positively associated with serum alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, creatinine, phosphorus, amylase, and anion gap and negatively associated with cholesterol levels, creatinine phosphokinase, eosinophils, and monocytes. Based on these relationships, the authors suggest that the PFC concentrations found in Charleston dolphins may have effects on immune, hematopoietic, kidney, and liver function. The results contribute to the emerging data on PFC health effects in this first study to describe associations between PFCs and health parameters in dolphins.",

Expression of genes related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, growth-hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH/IGF) axis and the steroid hormone axis were used as indicators of endocrine disruption. ...Also studied bone development in larvae, both by observing skeletal structure formation and by investigating expression of genes involved in ossification process. Atlantic salmon embryos, kept in plastic tanks at 5-7 Â°C, were exposed to 100 ug/L PFOA or PFOS from egg stage for a period of 52 days, followed by one-week recovery period. Sampling was performed at day 21, 35, 49 and 56 representing age 549, 597, 679 and 721 dd (dd or day degrees = number of days x temperature in degree Celsius: Â°C). Note that day 56 or 721 dd is the end of the 1-week recovery period. Larvae were divided into designated head and body regions for the purpose of gene expression analysis, except for genes that regulate ossification that were analyzed in whole larvae. Expression of thyroid receptor alpha and beta (TR-alpha and TR-beta), thyroid-stimulating hormone beta (TSH-beta), T(4) outer-ring deiodinase (T(4)ORD), growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-I and II (IGF-I and II), insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR), and estrogen receptor alpha and beta (ER-alpha and ER-beta) were investigated using quantitative PCR. Both PFOS and PFOA exposure produced non-significant alterations in larvae weight (except after the recovery period when a decrease was observed), while larvae length was unaffected. PFOS and PFOA exposure produced body- and head region-specific alterations in expression of all the investigated gene transcripts. Expression of IGF-I and IGF-IR paralleled that of GH, indicating that perturbation of GH expression is a possible end point for disruption of the GH-IGF axis. ...Developmental changes related to angiogenesis, ossification and chondrogenesis /were not observed/ after exposure to PFOS and PFOA. Transcriptional abnormalities may serve as indicators of chronic exposure, although the concrete mechanisms causing the observed effects remain ambiguous ...",

We developed a novel partial life-cycle assay that incorporates exposures to brooding adult female mussels and used this method in combination with acute toxicity tests to assess adverse effects of perfluoroctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA) on freshwater mussels. Fatmucket (Lampsilis siliquoidea) were exposed to PFOS at two life stages: brooding glochidia (in marsupia) for 36 d and free glochidia in water for 24 hr. In standard acute tests with glochidia (24-48 hr exposures) and juveniles (48-96 hr exposures) of fatmucket and black sandshell (Ligumia recta), glochidia were 8 to 25 times more sensitive than juveniles. Perfluoroctanesulfonic acid significantly reduced the duration of glochidia viability and reduced probability of metamorphosis at concentrations 3,000 times lower than the most sensitive acute endpoint (24-hr EC50). The partial life-cycle test is adaptable to a variety of endpoints and research objectives and is useful for identifying adverse effects at contaminant concentrations below those required for an acute lethal response.",

The primary objective of this study was to determine whether multiple PFAAs enhance hepatic tumorigenesis in trout, an animal model that represents human insensitivity to peroxisome proliferation. A two-stage chemical carcinogenesis model was employed in trout to evaluate PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (8:2FtOH) as complete carcinogens or promoters of aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1))- and/or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced liver cancer. A custom trout DNA microarray was used to assess hepatic transcriptional response to these dietary treatments in comparison with E2 and the classic peroxisome proliferator, clofibrate (CLOF). Incidence, multiplicity, and size of liver tumors in trout fed diets containing E2, PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA were significantly higher compared with AFB(1)-initiated animals fed control diet, whereas PFOS caused a minor increase in liver tumor incidence. E2 and PFOA also enhanced MNNG-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis. Pearson correlation analyses, unsupervised hierarchical clustering, and principal components analyses showed that the hepatic gene expression profiles for E2 and PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, and PFOS were overall highly similar, though distinct patterns of gene expression were evident for each treatment, particularly for PFNA. Overall, these data suggest that multiple PFAAs can promote liver cancer and that the mechanism of promotion may be similar to that of E2.",

                          "String": "Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid's former production and use in the manufacture of polymers and fluorinated surfactants for application in surface treatments, paper protection and performance chemicals has resulted in its release to the environment through various waste streams. Through 2001, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was used to manufacture Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) used to extinguish flammable liquid fires, such as fires involving gas tankers and oil refineries, which resulted in its direct release to the environment. PFOS chemicals are no longer manufactured in the US, but specific technical applications are still permitted. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid can be formed in the environment through microbial or abiotic degradation processes from related precursor compounds. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.0X10-3 mm Hg at 25 Â°C indicates perfluorooctane sulfonic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase perfluorooctane sulfonic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 115 days. Vapor-phase perfluorooctane sulfonic acid can adsorb to atmospheric particulate matter and be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is not susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Monitoring data from remote Arctic sites indicate the compound is subject to long-range transport. If released to soil, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is expected to have moderate to no mobility based upon a measured Koc range of 250-50,100. An average measured Koc of 1000 indicates low mobility in soil. The pKa of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is <1.0, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Although anions will not volatilize from moist soil surfaces, the unique surfactant properties of PFOS may prevent its total dissociation in moist soil. Therefore, some volatilization may occur since the neutral forms of perfluoroalkyls are considered to be volatile. Although perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure, it may be volatile. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is resistant to biodegradation and does not biodegrade under typical environmental conditions. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid can have low to very high adsorption to suspended solids and sediment based on a field-derived Koc range of 126 to 39,800. The strength of sorption in water can vary depending on the nature of the sediment material with respect to pH, organic content, mineral content, salinity and other factors. Volatilization of the anionic form of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. A BCF range of 200-1500 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound has an extrapolated hydrolysis half-life of >41 years. Occupational exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing perfluorooctane sulfonic acid. Studies have found perfluorooctylsulfonate chemicals in very small quantities in the blood of the general human population as well as in wildlife, indicating that exposure to the chemicals, including pristine environments, is widespread.

The major uses for the perfluorooctane sulfonic acid-related substances were providing grease, oil and water resistance to materials such as textiles, carpets, paper and in general coatings(4); for example, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was used in the production of 3M Corporation's popular Scotchguard fabric protector through 2000(5). Through 2001, PFOS was used to manufacture Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) used to extinguish flammable liquid fires (hydrocarbon fueled), such as fires involving gas tankers and oil refineries, which resulted in its direct release to the environment(3). PFOS chemicals are no longer manufactured in the US; however, EPA Significant New Use Rules (SNURs) allow for the continuation of a few, limited, highly technical applications of PFOS-related substances where no known alternatives are available(3). In addition, existing stocks of PFC-based chemicals that were manufactured or imported into the US before the effective date of the SNURs (for example, PFOS-based AFFF produced before the rules took effect in 2002) can still be used(3). Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid can be formed in the environment through microbial or abiotic degradation processes from a group of related substances or precursor compounds(2,3). Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is a conversion product of incomplete oxidation during the incineration of perfluoroalkyl sulfonate-containing materials(6).",

Vapor-phase perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 115 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.4X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 Â°C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). Monitoring data has detected perfluorooctane sulfonic acid in both vapor and particulate phases in ambient air samples(3). Vapor-phase perfluorooctane sulfonic acid can adsorb to atmospheric particulate matter and be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(4,5). It has been detected in rain and snow samples(3). Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is not susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(4,5). Monitoring data from remote Arctic sites indicate the compound is subject to long-range transport either through atmospheric transport of precursor compounds followed by degradation to form PFOS or through atmospheric aerosol transport(4,5).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 115 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is resistant to environmental degradation processes such as direct photolysis and hydrolysis(2,3). No hydrolytic loss of the potassium salt of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid was observed during a 49-day study at pH values of 1.5, 5, 7, 9, or 11 at 50 Â°C(4); a hydrolysis half-life was extrapolated to be greater than 41 years at 25 Â°C(4). Following irradiation of the potassium salt of PFOS with light of wavelength 290-800 nm for 67-167 hours, it was concluded that there was no evidence of direct photolysis of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid under any of the test conditions(2). Perfluorinated compound recalcitrance can be attributed to the stability conferred by fluorine substitutes and the absence of structures susceptible to eletrophilic or nucleophilic attack(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                          "String": "A literature review of Koc values derived from laboratory sorption experiments using a variety of soils and sediments found the average and median log Koc values for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid to be 3.0 and 2.8(1), respectively, which correspond to Koc values of 1000 and 630(SRC); the log Koc range was 2.4 to 4.7 (Koc of 250 to 50,100)(1). Partitioning experiments using three sediments taken from the Tokyo Bay, Bay determined mean log Koc values 3.4 to 3.7 for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (Koc values of 2510 to 5010)(2). A laboratory-derived mean log Koc of 2.57 for perfluorooctanoic acid on sediments has been reported(3) corresponding to a Koc of 370(SRC). A log Koc of 3.34 (Koc of 2190) was measured for an agricultural soil from an area where municipal biosolids had been applied(4). According to a classification scheme(5), the average and mean Koc values derived in laboratory tests suggest that perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is expected to have low mobility in soil. The range of Koc values (log 2.4-4.7) suggest that perfluorooctane sulfonic acid may have moderate mobility to immobility in soil. The pKa of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is <1.0(6), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(7). The strength of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid sorption to sediment and suspended material in water can vary depending on the nature of the sediment material with respect to pH, organic content, mineral content, salinity and other factors(1,2). Sorption in sediment was found to increase with increasing Ca(2+) and decreasing pH and be affected more by organic carbon than iron oxide content(3). In marine environments where suspended solid concentrations are low, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid may be transported in dissolved phase rather than being adsorbed to suspended solids(2). Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is thought to adsorb strongly to soil and sediment, based on reported Kd and Freundlich adsorption coefficient values of 18.3 and 25.1, respectively, in clay; 9.72 and 14.0, respectively, in clay loam; 35.3 and 28.2, respectively, in sandy loam; and 7.42 and 8.70, respectively, in river sediment(8). A Koc of 710 was calculated for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid based on Kd values for six soils(9).",

Levels in tap water collected in China, Japan, India, United States, and Canada between 2006 and 2008 ranged from a high of 4 ng/L in China to not detected in India(2). A concentration of 5 ng/L was reported for tap water samples from Arnsberg, Germany in May 2006(3). Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid was detected in 11% of 456 drinking water samples collected in 13 European countries during the period 2006 to 2012(4); concentrations measured ranged from 0.001 to 0.016 ug/kg; mean upper bound concentrations in tap, well and bottled water were 0.0039, 0.0017 and 0.0017 ug/kg respectively(4). Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid was detected in 87-88% of 41 tap water samples collected in France in 2010 at an average and median concentration range of 2-6 ng/L(5). Analysis of 62 potable water samples collected from 34 locations in Australia in 2010 detected a concentration range of 0-16 ng/L(6).",

Concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate in the blood plasma of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) collected from the midwestern United States ranged from 13 to  2,220 ng/mL (mean: 330 ng/mL); concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate were greater in blood plasma than in whole blood. Among 82 livers from various species of birds from inland or coastal U.S. locations, Brandt's cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus) from San Diego, CA, contained the greatest concentration of perfluorooctane sulfonate (1,780 ng/g, wet wt). Perfluorooctane sulfonate was also found in the sera of albatrosses from the central North Pacific Ocean at concentrations ranging from 3 to 34 ng/mL. Occurrence of perfluorooctane sulfonate in birds from remote marine locations suggests widespread distribution of perfluorooctane sulfonate and related fluorochemicals in the environment.
