PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), an anionic surfactant, is a common ingredient of cosmetic and personal care products. SDS is \"readily biodegradable\" with low toxicity and \"is of no concern with respect to human health\". Up to 1 g of SDS/kg is the maximum safe dose for children. Alkyl sulfates, including SDS, are microbicidal against HIV types 1 and 2, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), human papillomaviruses and chlamydia. /The study/ hypothesizes that SDS treatment of milk will inactivate HIV-1 without significant harm to its nutritional value and protective functions and may define a treatment of choice for breastwas at 37 degrees C for 10 min. SDS-PAGE and Lowry were used to analyze protein content. Antibody content and function was studied by rocket immunoelectrophoresis (RIE), immunoturbodimentric (ITM) quantitation and ELISA. The creamatocrit was also analyzed. HIV-1 infectivity was measured by MAGI assay. SDS removal was by Detergent-OutN (Geno Technology, Inc.). SDS quantitation is by methylene blue-chloroform method. Inactivation of HIV-1 with SDS occurs at or above 0.025%. In milk samples, 1% and 0.1% SDS reduced HSV-2 infectivity. At least 90% of SDS can be efficiently removed with Detergent-OutN, with protein recovery of 80%-100%. Gross protein species are conserved as indicated by PAGE analyses. Fat and energy content of SDS-treated breast milk remains unchanged. 0.1% SDS can be removed from human milk without altering the creamatocrit. ELISA of serum IgG (rubella) proved it remains functional in the presence of SDS and after its removal. sIgA, IgG and IgM in breast milk are conserved after SDS-treatment when measured by RIE and ITM. CONCLUSIONS: SDS (0.025%) can inactivate HIV-1 in vitro and HSV-2 in breast milk. SDS can be efficiently removed from milk samples. SDS treatment of milk does not significantly alter protein content. Antibody function in serum and levels in breast milk are maintained after treatment and removal of SDS. 0.1% SDS does not alter fat concentration in milk and energy content is conserved. SDS or related compounds may be used to prevent breast milk transmission of HIV-1.",

Direct immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses demonstrated that primary vaginal keratinocytes expressed epithelial cell-specific keratin proteins. Experiments that compared vaginal keratinocyte sensitivity to each agent during a continuous, 48-hr exposure demonstrated that primary vaginal keratinocytes were almost five times more sensitive to N-9 than to either C31G or SDS. To evaluate the effect of multiple microbicide exposures on cell viability, primary vaginal keratinocytes were exposed to N-9, C31G, or SDS three times during a 78-hr period. In these experiments, cells were considerably more sensitive to C31G than to N-9 or SDS at lower concentrations within the range tested. When agent concentrations were chosen to result in an endpoint of 25% viability after three daily exposures, each exposure decreased cell viability at the same constant rate. When time-dependent sensitivity during a continuous 48-hr exposure was examined, exposure to C31G for 18 hr resulted in losses in cell viability not caused by either N-9 or SDS until at least 24 to 48 hr. Cumulatively, these results reveal important variations in time- and concentration-dependent sensitivity to N-9, C31G, or SDS within populations of primary human vaginal keratinocytes cultured in vitro. These investigations represent initial steps toward both in vitro modeling of the vaginal microenvironment and studies of factors that impact the in vivo efficacy of vaginal topical microbicides.",

                          "String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: Sodium lauryl sulfate is a white or cream-colored crystal, flake, or powder with a faint odor. Sodium dodecyl sulfate is used in general as a detergent, dispersant, and surfactant. Pure sodium dodecyl sulfate is used mainly in dentifrice products (a powder, paste, or liquid for cleaning the teeth), in hair shampoos, and in emulsion polymerization. The rest is either used in special cosmetic formulations, e.g. for bubble baths and hair bleaches, or as a fine chemical, e.g. as denaturing agent in gel electrophoresis. Besides pure sodium dodecyl sulfate detergent, manufacturers usually produce \"technical grade\" sodium dodecyl sulfate, a product that consists of approximately 70 % sodium dodecyl sulfate and 30 % sodium tetradecyl sulfate. This product is generally called sodium lauryl sulfate. Technical grade sodium dodecyl sulfate is used as a detergent in dish-washing products (main use), as additive for plastics and latices, and in paints and lacquers. Sodium lauryl sulfate is used as a flea and tick repellant in one registered pesticide product--a flea and tick shampoo for cats and dogs. Sodium lauryl sulfate also is a widely used component of many nonpesticidal consumer products currently marketed in the United States, including shampoos and fruit juices. It is also used in hydraulic fracturing to prevent the formation of emulsions in the fracture fluid. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Among 242 patients suffering from eczematous dermatitis, the percentage of allergic reactions reached 54.6%. A great number of allergic reactions to sodium lauryl sulfate (6.4%) was observed. The study was conducted to compare the effects of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)-free and SLS-containing dentifrice (a powder, paste, or liquid for cleaning the teeth) in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). Although SLS-free products did not reduce the number of ulcers and episodes, it affected the ulcer-healing process and reduces pain in daily lives in patients with RAS. ANIMAL STUDIES: The repeated dose toxicity of sodium dodecyl sulphate was studied extensively. Tests range from sub-acute (28 days) to chronic (2 years in rat) studies. Further, the substance was tested in two different species (rat and dog) and by means of two different routes of administration (diet and gavage). The primary effect of sodium dodecyl sulphate in animals is a local irritation of the gastro-intestinal tract. Developmental toxicity/teratogenicity of sodium dodecyl sulphate was investigated in three different species. Mice and rabbits are the most sensitive species. Sodium dodecyl sulphate was extensively tested for genetic toxicity. Neither the bacterial tests nor the various tests in mammalian systems (in vitro and in vivo) have shown any indication of genotoxicity with or without metabolic activation. Published reports suggest that sodium lauryl sulfate has low acute mammalian toxicity and no known chronic effects. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Uptake, tissue distribution, and elimination of lauryl sulfate were investigated in carp. The chemical concentrated in hepatopancreas and gallbladder. Maximum whole-body levels were reached during 24-72 hr. Survival time decreased with increased water hardness. Sodium lauryl sulfate has been tested as a repellent against several species of sharks. It did not provoke a repellency response at a low enough concentration to function effectively as a classical, surrounding-cloud type, repellent. The range of potency, however, does allow it to be used as a directional repellent.",

The factors that play a role in polysensitization are largely unknown. Identifying these risk factors is important with regard to future studies on the aetiology of contact allergy. To investigate whether enhanced skin irritability is a risk factor for the development of polysensitization to fragrance chemicals, one hundred participants characterized by fragrance contact allergy were included in /this/ study. The participants were patch tested on the back with 25 individual fragrance chemicals and fragrance mixes... and on the upper arm with sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) (consisting of SLS concentrations of 0.45%, 0.67%, 1%, and 1.5%). Reading of both tests was performed during the following visits at days 2, 3, and 7. The response to SLS was monitored by measuring transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Polysensitization was defined as three or more allergic reactions to non-cross-reacting fragrance chemical allergens. Individuals with polysensitization showed significantly higher irritation responses to SLS 1% and 1.5% as assessed by TEWL. /The study/ found an enhanced skin irritation response to be a risk factor for the development of polysensitization to fragrance chemicals.",

Four fields on the volar forearm of healthy aged and young volunteers (median age, respectively, 63.9 and 32.6 years) were sequentially exposed to 0.5% SLS and undiluted toluene in a controlled tandem repeated irritation test; an adjacent nontreated field served as control. The permeability barrier function was monitored by repeated measurements of transepidermal water loss (TEWL), capacitance and erythema every 24 hr up to 96 hr. The stratum corneum cytokines were harvested by sequential tape stripping and quantified by multiplex bead array and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Compared with young skin, aged skin was characterized by delayed and/or less pronounced alterations in the visual irritation score, TEWL, chromametry a*-value and capacitance, assessed by the respective delta-values for each parameter and monitoring time point. In both groups, exposure to SLS/SLS, SLS/Tol and Tol/SLS resulted in decreased interleukin (IL)-1alpha levels, whereas the application of Tol/Tol induced an increase in IL-1alpha. Furthermore, decreased IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) levels and a lower IL-1RA/IL-1alpha ratio were found following repeated exposure to the irritants. Our results provide evidence for selective alterations in the cytokine profile and distinct barrier impairment kinetic following tandem repeated irritation with SLS and Tol in aged compared with young skin in vivo.",

A single application of the gel formulation containing 3% foscarnet given 24 hr postinfection exerted only a modest effect on the development of herpetic skin lesions. Of prime interest, the addition of 5% SLS to this gel formulation markedly reduced the mean lesion score. The improved efficacy of the foscarnet formulation containing SLS could be attributed to an increased penetration of the antiviral agent into the epidermis. In vitro, SLS decreased in a concentration-dependent manner the infectivities of herpes viruses for Vero cells. SLS also inhibited the HSV-1 strain F-induced cytopathic effect. Combinations of foscarnet and SLS resulted in subsynergistic to subantagonistic effects, depending on the concentration used. Foscarnet in phosphate-buffered saline decreased in a dose-dependent manner the viability of cultured human skin fibroblasts. This toxic effect was markedly decreased when foscarnet was incorporated into the polymer matrix. The presence of SLS in the gel formulations did not alter the viabilities of these cells. The use of gel formulations containing foscarnet and SLS could represent an attractive approach to the treatment of herpetic mucocutaneous lesions, especially those caused by acyclovir-resistant strains.",

Results showed that pretreatment of HSV type 1 (HSV-1) strain F and HSV-2 strain 333 with either surfactant inhibited, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, their infectivities on Vero cells. SLS was a more potent inhibitor of HSV-2 strain 333 infectivity than LS with respect to the concentration (4.8-fold lower) and time (2.4-fold shorter) required to completely inactivate the virus. No inhibition of both herpes virus strains infectivities was observed when Vero cells were pretreated with either surfactant. LS prevented the binding of HSV-2 strain 333 to cells without affecting the stable attachment and the rate of penetration into cells, whereas SLS exerted the opposite effect. Both SLS and LS inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, the HSV-2 strain 333-induced cytopathic effect, probably by affecting newly synthesized virions that come into contact with surfactant molecules present in culture medium. The pretreatment of HSV-2 strain 333 with specific combinations of SLS and LS concentrations inhibited the viral infectivity in a synergistic manner and resulted in only a small increase in their toxicities for exponentially growing Vero cells compared with that caused by each compound alone. Taken together, these results suggest that SLS and LS, alone or combined, could represent potent candidates as microbicides in topical vaginal formulations to prevent the transmission of herpes and possibly other pathogens that cause sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1.",

Materials and methods:  The design of this study was a double-blind crossover trial. The 90 subjects were divided into three groups: group I used SLS-free (a commercially available SLS-free dentifrice) and SLS-A (SLS-free + 1.5% SLS), group II used SLS-A and SLS-B (a commercially available 1.5% SLS-containing dentifrice), and group III used SLS-free and SLS-B. The subjects used one of the two assigned dentifrices for 8 weeks and then the other for the following 8 weeks. The order of the dentifrices used was selected at random, and there was a 2-week washout period between the two phases. The clinical parameters (number of ulcers, number of episodes, duration of ulcers, mean pain score) were compared between the two phases for each group.  Results:  The number of ulcers and episodes did not differ significantly between SLS-A, SLS-B, and SLS-free. Only duration of ulcers and mean pain score was significantly decreased during the period using SLS-free.  Conclusion:  Although SLS-free did not reduce the number of ulcers and episodes, it affected the ulcer-healing process and reduces pain in daily lives in patients with RAS.",

Because no signs of toxicity were observed after two weeks, for the animals in group 4 the dose was increased to 600 mg/kg body weight. At termination of the experiment hematological investigation and macroscopic/microscopic examination were carried out. Whereas in the low and middle dose group no treatment-related changes were observed, the following changes were recorded for the high dose group: decreased weight gain (males), increased relative weights of kidney, brain and liver, decrease of thymus weight, ulcerations and bleedings in the stomach, and reversible alterations of the tongue, myocardium and forestomach. Further, significant increased levels of the enzyme alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) were found. In conjunction with the observed increase in liver weight this is judged to indicate the onset of hepatotoxicity. Result : NOAEL = 100 mg/kg/day LOAEL = 300/600 mg/kg/day",

Effective concentration thresholds (EC50s) were calculated for two levels of response: (1) minimum noticeable and (2) strong. The SLS EC50s were: horn shark 43.6 and 174.5 ppm; swell shark 95.1 and 160.0 ppm; and leopard shark inconclusive and 113.1 ppm. No response was discernible from cupric acetate. Rotenone evoked a weak response with an EC50 of 5.7 ppm, but no strong response.  The ratio of the minimum noticeable EC50: 24-hour lethal concentration (LC50) indicated the relative repellency (compared to toxicity) of the chemicals. The ratio for SLS was 19:1 and for rotenone 57:1. SLS did not provoke a repellency response at a low enough concentration to function effectively as a classical, surrounding-cloud type, repellent. The range of potency of SLS, however, does allow it to be used as a directional repellent.",

Its use to prevent the formation of emulsions in hydraulic fracturing fluid will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.7X10-13 mm Hg at 25 Â°C indicates sodium lauryl sulfate will exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase sodium lauryl sulfate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Sodium lauryl sulfate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, sodium lauryl sulfate is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a water solubility of 1.00X10+5 mg/L and that it is a salt. Sodium lauryl sulfate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 85% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, sodium lauryl sulfate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's water solubility and that it is a salt. An estimated BCF of 71 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (ph 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to sodium lauryl sulfate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where sodium lauryl sulfate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to sodium lauryl sulfate via ingestion of and dermal contact with consumer products containing sodium lauryl sulfate. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",
