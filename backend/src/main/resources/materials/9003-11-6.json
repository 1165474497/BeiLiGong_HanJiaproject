PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

P188 was originally approved by the FDA in the 1960s as a therapeutic agent to reduce viscosity in the blood before transfusions, however it is no longer available in any approved products. Due to its sufactant properties, P188 may also be found in over-the-counter (OTC) products such as toothpaste, laxatives and mouthwash, and used in various cosmetic, industrial and pharmaceutical applications. There is an evidence of P188 increasing the structural stability and resealing of the plasma membrane via direct incorporation into the phospholipid bilayer. The ability of P188 in attenuating membrane damage and cell injury has been demonstrated in a variety of in vivo and in vitro models. The use of P188 as a potential treatment in different pathological conditions, such as chronic microvascular diseases and skeletal muscle deficiencies, is under investigation.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The surfactant utilized for wound cleansing is Pluronic F-68 (poloxalene; I), a member of a family of block copolymers called Pluronic polyls. Long term toxicity studies and clinical trials suggest that this surfactant is safe for human use. I is a nonionic detergent that does not have any intrinsic antibacterial activity. Although mechanical cleansing with saline-soaked sponges effectively removes bacteria, it damages the wound and impairs its resistance to infection. The severity of the damage to the skin exerted by the sponge can be correlated with its porosity. Sponges with a low porosity are abrasive and exert more damage to skin than do sponges with a higher porosity. The addition of I to even the most abrasive sponges ensures that the bacterial removal efficiency of the sponge scrub is maintained, while tissue trauma is minimized. This dual effect of the surfactant results in a dramatic reduction in the infection rate of contaminated wounds.",

In a murine hind-limb model, P188 mediated a protective action against ischemia-reperfusion injury as indicated by decreased myocyte injury, preserved tissue adenosine 5'-triphosphate levels, and improved survival rates, suggesting that P188 can seal defects in cell membranes and attenuate damage induced by reactive oxygen species. P188 was shown to elicit protective effects against excitotoxic injury, and trauma-induced necrotic and apoptotic cell death in cultured neurons. In the mouse stroke models, P188 exerted a neuroprotective effect in brain ischemia-reperfusion induced acute injury by significantly reducing infarct volume and water content in brain edema and ameliorating the neurological symptoms 24 h after ischemia or reperfusion injury. P188 also significantly inhibited inflammatory, coagulation, and apoptotic responses resulting from superior mesenteric artery occlusion. In the experimental model of striatum injury in rats, P188 was shown to reduce excitotoxicity-induced tissue loss and macrophage infiltrate.",

Only trace quantities of the 14C-PX were recovered in liver and carcass at termination of the study. Two studies were also performed with 14C-PX incorporated into the diet. In the first feeding study of 7 days duration, most of the agent was excreted via the gastrointestinal tract within 72 hr of discontinuing treatment. In the second study, rats were fed dietary 14C-PX for 7, 14, or 23 days to determine whether the surfactant continued to accumulate in the body as the test period was extended. Further accumulation did occur between the 7th and 14th days but not when feeding was continued for a total of 23 days. Of the amount of 14C-PX ingested after 23 days of feeding, essentially all was excreted by the end of 7 days after discontinuing treatment. These studies indicate that despite its large molecular weight of about 3,000 some 14C-PX is absorbed.

The full mechanism of action of P188 in inducing cytoprotective effects is not clear; however, based on _in vitro_ experiments and the structural similarity to plasmalemma, P188 may be directly incorporated into the phospholipid bilayer to attenuate the extent of tissue injury. Its high surface activity facilitates P188 to be inserted into lipid monolayers. P188 is proposed to exert localized actions by only interacting with damaged and compromised bilayers where the local lipid packing density is reduced. In addition to the direct interaction with the membrane, P188 was shown to inhibit MMP-9 protein levels and activity, as well as the NF-ÎºB signal pathway, in the model of acute cerebral ischemia, which is associated with increased BBB permeability leading to cerebral edema and increased penetration. MMP-9 is a key factor in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and BBB disruption."

Rats injected with 0.33 g/kg/day for 4 days demonstrated a significant increase in the number of monocytes when compared to controls. Administration of 1.0 g/kg/day for 4 days demonstrated distinct splenomegaly when compared to control animals.

Another group received plain atherogenic diet alone and a control group was fed chow. After this period, serum lipoproteins were separated by centrifugation and analyzed. The composition of lipoproteins from rabbits on atherogenic diet was abnormal. The cholesterol: triglyceride ratio of every lipoprotein fraction was significantly increased as was the cholesterol: protein ratio of very low density lipoproteins. Supplementing the diet with Poloxalene 2930 prevented these alterations. In all groups on the atherogenic diet the percentage of apolipoprotein E in VLDL and HDL increased. In the case of Poloxalene-treated rabbits this developed even though serum cholesterol levels were normal or slightly increased.

The composition of the diet used as the vehicle for administration had a considerable effect on these results. When semipurified diets were used, food intake and weight gain were greatest when the dietary fat content was at the highest level. When the surfactant was given in ground chow, food intake was not affected and weight gain was only slightly, but significantly, less than the controls as a result of mild fat malabsorption. It is concluded that poloxalene 2930 affects lipid absorption, food intake, and serum cholesterol concentration but that results of this treatment are considerably affected by dietary factors.",
