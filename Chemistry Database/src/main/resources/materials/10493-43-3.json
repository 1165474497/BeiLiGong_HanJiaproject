CAUTION: For LNG - Liquefied natural gas (UN1972), DO NOT apply water, regular or alcohol-resistant foam directly on spill. Use a high-expansion foam if available to reduce vapors. Prevent spreading of vapors through sewers, ventilation systems and confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed.
